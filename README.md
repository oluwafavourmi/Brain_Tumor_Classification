# Brain_Tumor_Classification

In the era of Artificial Intelligence, we can all see that AI has been beneficial in all facet of life, helping humans to either speed up tasks or attaining incredible feats, one of such feats is in the medical space

This project is about using Convolutional Neural Networks to dectect brain tumors(in this case BENING and MALIGNANT variants are only focused on)
Although the CNN used for this model was built from scratch and the concept of transfer learning was not used, In summary three outer nodes were put in the outer layer neural network, one for BENING, another for MALIGNANT and the last one for a normal brain. This project is still in development and more training and improvement will be done as time progresses.
